# Titanic-Survival

For this project I analyzed data from the passengers on board the Titanic. I created a Logistic Regression model that predicts which passengers survived the sinking of the ship, based on features like age and ticket class. The RMS Titanic set sail on its maiden voyage in 1912, crossing the Atlantic from Southampton, England, to New York City. The ship never completed the voyage, it sank to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean after hitting an iceberg, bringing down 1,502 of 2,224 passengers on board.  


Throughout the project you will be able to find:

* Data cleaning and standardization.
* Features and labels for model.
* Logistic Regression Model.
